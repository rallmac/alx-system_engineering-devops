#Additional elements in my new whiteboard
* These are other devices that has been added to boost the
  the network productivity

#Servers
* One more server has been added to make it a total of two servers
  one server can now be used for the web while the other one
  is used for the app.

* The web server handles http requests. the app server holds the
  code base. this serves to handle more requests

#HAproxy Load-balancers
* This distributes the request evenly between the two servers to
  improve the appliction performance and also redirect users
  to a closer server and reduce network latency	

* HAproxy stands for High Availability proxy load balancer. It is
  widely used and it is open source. It is highly available and can
  provide resources even if one ore more servers become unavailable

#Web server
* This server handles HTTPS requests

#Application Server
* This server serves application querries. this makes the network trafic
  of users more scalable

#Database
* This stores the informtion inputed by the users. This informtion can
  be retrieved and reused upon request for it. the information is readily
  available particularly because the servers are present, the load balancer
  and all other additional component of this structure.
  
* This structure will eliminate attacks, implement adequate monitoring
  and regulate trafic for a smooth running of the website
