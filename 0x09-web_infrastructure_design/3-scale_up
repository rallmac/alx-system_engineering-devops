#Additional elements in my new whiteboard
* These are other devices that has been added to boost the
  the network productivity

#Servers
* One more server has been added to make it a total of two servers
  one server can now be used for the web while the other one
  is used for the app.

* The web server handles http requests. the app server holds the
  code base. this serves to handle more requests

#HAproxy Load-balancers
* This distributes the request evenly between the two servers to
  improve the appliction performance and also redirect users
  to a closer server and reduce network latency	

* HAproxy stands for High Availability proxy load balancer. It is
  widely used and it is open source. It is highly available and can
  provide resources even if one ore more servers become unavailable
