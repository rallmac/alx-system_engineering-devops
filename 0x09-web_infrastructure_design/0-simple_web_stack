WHAT ARE THE ISSUES WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE?
------------------------------------------------------------------
# SPOF
* This refers to Single Point Of Failure
  This happens when a component of the server fails, causing the
  entire server to experience downtime

# Downtime experienced due to deployment of new codes
* Deployment of new codes will cause the server to be restarted
  during restart, there will bw downtime

# Cannot scale if too much traffic
* This is when load ballancing comes in. Load ballancing use variety of
  methods to make the web pages ready available when the clients request
  for it. It is costly and not quite easy to maintain
