#Additional elements in my new whiteboard
* These are other devices that has been added to boost the
  the network productivity

#Servers
* One more server has been added to make it a total of two servers
  one server can now be used for the web while the other one
  is used for the app.

* The web server handles http requests. the app server holds the
  code base. this serves to handle more requests

#Load-balancer
* This distributes the request evenly between the two servers to
  improve the appliction performance and also redirect users
  to a closer server and reduce network latency	

#HAproxy Load-balancer
* HAproxy stands for High Availability proxy load balancer. It is
  widely used and it is open source. It is highly available and can
  provide resources even if one ore more servers become unavailable


#Active-Passive setup
* In this kind of setup, one node is always active. and the other
  is on standby in case of any failure. on the other hand
#Active-Active setup is usefull for Gaming, Online trading and 
  e-commerce platforms. In this kind of setup, the two nodes are
  active to process requests simultaneously my server is configured
  to use Active-Active setup. It is an e-commerce website


#How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
* This involves a primary (master) database that handles all
  write operations and updates, while one or more replica (slave)
  databases replicate the primary's data in real-time and handle
  read operations. This setup enhances read scalability and
  provides redundancy. Changes to the primary are asynchronously
  or synchronously propagated to the replicas, ensuring data
  consistency across the cluster.

#What is the difference between the Primary and the Replica node
# in regard to the application
* In an application using a Primary-Replica setup, the primary node
  is responsible for handling all write operations, such as inserts,
  updates, and deletes, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
  In contrast, replica nodes handle read operations, allowing the
  application to distribute read queries across multiple nodes, improving
  read performance and reducing the load on the primary node. The replicas
  periodically synchronize with the primary to maintain data consistency

WHAT ARE THE ISSUES WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE?
------------------------------------------------------------------
# Where are SPOF
* This is typically located in the master Node. If the master node
  fails, write operation will be not work, causing a downtime until
  a new master node is promoted

# Security issues(no firewall, no HTTPS)
* Unrestricted Access: Without a firewall, all network traffic can
  freely enter and exit the network, making it vulnerable to unauthorized
  access, malware, and attacks such as DDoS.

* Data Interception: Without HTTPS, data transmitted between clients and
  servers is unencrypted, making it susceptible to interception and
  eavesdropping by attackers.

* Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Lack of HTTPS allows attackers to perform
  man-in-the-middle attacks, where they can alter or intercept
  communications without detection.

* Lack of Data Integrity: Without HTTPS, there is no guarantee that
  the data received is the data sent, as it can be tampered with in
  transit.

# No monitoring
* Delayed Incident Response: Without monitoring, identifying and
  responding to network issues or security breaches is significantly
  delayed, leading to prolonged downtime and increased damage.

* Undetected Anomalies: Network problems, such as unusual traffic
  patterns, hardware failures, or unauthorized access attempts,
  go unnoticed, compromising performance and security.

* Performance Degradation: Without monitoring, it's challenging to
  track and manage network performance metrics, leading to undetected
  bottlenecks and degraded user experiences.

* Compliance and Auditing Failures: Many regulatory frameworks
  require detailed logging and monitoring for compliance; without it,
  organizations risk non-compliance and potential legal consequences.
